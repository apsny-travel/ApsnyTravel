# UI Guidelines (v0.0.0)

## Tone
- Warm winter guide, calm and trustworthy; family-run vibe.
- Avoid aggressive marketing; focus on clarity and readability.

## Colors
- Base background: `#0f172a`.
- Primary text: `#e5e7eb`; secondary text: `#9ca3af`.
- Light neutral accent/surface: Cloud Dancer (PANTONE 11-4201) — use as light cards/accents where contrast is needed.
- Use accent sparingly to maintain calm feel.

## Typography and layout
- Prefer a clear, readable sans-serif stack; use weight/size for hierarchy rather than decoration.
- Generous spacing and clear sectioning; avoid dense walls of text.
- Cards and sections should be simple, with subtle dividers or soft shadows only if needed.

## Interactions
- Links and buttons should be obvious but understated; deep-links should be visible without being loud.
- Keep motion minimal and meaningful (e.g., gentle hover, staggered reveal if desired).

## Responsiveness
- Mobile-first readable layout; avoid horizontal scroll.
- Ensure nav/footer and cards wrap gracefully; images scale without breaking text flow.
