# Definition of Done — v0.0.0

- Build passes (dev and production build/export) with no blocking errors.
- Routes exist and render correctly: `/`, `/tours`, `/tours/lake-ritsa-winter`, `/places/gagra`, `/places/blue-lake`, `/places/lake-ritsa`, `/contacts`.
- Capsules for flagship tour and places exist, validate against schema, and render on their pages.
- Deep-links `[[slug]]` resolve to existing capsules; `links[].targetSlug` valid; tour contains places, places part_of tour.
- UI matches tone: dark base with Cloud Dancer accents, readable on mobile and desktop.
- Contacts page shows real, clear contact methods.
