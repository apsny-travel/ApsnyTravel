# Business Background

## People
- Father: experienced guide/organizer in Sochi → Abkhazia; knows the routes and seasonality; sells via aggregators, referrals, personal network.
- Son: developer who wants to help quickly without over-engineering.

## Reality and constraints
- Winter season matters; the flagship winter tour must be presentable and easy to understand.
- Avoid heavy systems; keep it maintainable by one person.
- The site should both help sell (clear contact info, believable copy) and guide (places have standalone value).

## Tone implications
- Honest, calm language; no exaggerated marketing.
- Emphasize trust and clarity (route structure, stops, timing, contacts).
- Show connections: where the tour goes, what places are included, why each stop matters.
