# v1.0 Draft Vision (future, not for now)

## Direction
- Expand from 1 tour to a lineup (8-15 winter/summer options).
- Grow places to ~30-60 to strengthen the guide layer.
- Add simple guides/activities where useful (still capsule-based).

## Possible features (after v0.0.0)
- Simple lead/hand-off flows (request to contact, not full booking).
- Better related/nearby recommendations using the graph.
- Lightweight partner/affiliate flows.

## Guardrails for v1 thinking
- Keep capsule primacy and SSG where possible; avoid heavy backend unless the project phase changes.
- Any new feature should be incremental and reversible; do not derail the small, maintainable core.
